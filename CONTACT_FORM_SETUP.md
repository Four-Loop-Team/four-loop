# Contact Form Backend Setup Guide 🚀

## Quick Start

Your contact form backend is now complete! Here's how to get it fully operational:

### 1. Get Your Resend API Key

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and create an account
2. Navigate to **API Keys** section
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy your API key (starts with `re_`)

### 2. Configure Environment

Update your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Resend API key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here

# Email configuration (already set)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_RECIPIENT=scott@fourloopdigital.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL=contact@fourloopdigital.com
```

### 3. Domain Verification (Production)

For production emails, verify your domain in Resend:

1. Go to **Domains** in Resend dashboard
2. Add `fourloopdigital.com`
3. Add the provided DNS records to your domain
