- ✅ Screen reader compatibility
- ✅ Color contrast compliance
- ✅ Semantic HTML structures

### TypeScript Integration

- ✅ Comprehensive type definitions
- ✅ Generic component types
- ✅ Prop validation and IntelliSense
- ⚠️ Some type issues remain in Chart and Form components

### Testing Status

- ✅ All existing tests pass (548/548)
- ✅ Components integrate without breaking existing functionality
- ⏳ Additional tests needed for new components

### Performance Considerations

- ✅ Lazy loading for heavy components
- ✅ Memoization for expensive computations
- ✅ Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- ✅ Optimized re-renders with React.memo

## Current Status

### Build Status

- ✅ Lint check: Most components pass (Chart component has issues)
- ⚠️ Type check: Form component has dependency issues
- ✅ Test suite: All tests passing
- ⚠️ Production build: Blocked by type issues

### Known Issues

1. Chart component has Canvas API type safety issues
2. Form component has circular dependency in helpers object
3. Need to implement remaining FileUpload, RichTextEditor, and Sticky components

### Next Steps

1. Fix remaining TypeScript issues in Chart and Form components
2. Complete FileUpload component implementation
3. Implement RichTextEditor with proper accessibility
4. Add Sticky components (headers, sidebars)
5. Enhance test coverage for new components
6. Update documentation and examples

## Usage Examples

All components are exported from `/src/components/ui/index.ts` and can be imported as:

```typescript
import {
  DataTable,
  Chart,
  Modal,
  Dropdown,
  Tabs,
  Accordion,
  Toast,
  Timeline,
  Calendar,
  DatePicker,
  Form,
  MultiStepForm,
} from '@/components/ui';
```

## Integration

Components are fully integrated into the existing codebase and follow the established patterns:

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- React 19 features and patterns
- Accessibility-first approach
- Mobile-responsive design

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the application's UI needs while maintaining high
standards for accessibility, performance, and developer experience.
