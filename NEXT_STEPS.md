# ðŸš€ NEXT STEPS: Advanced Integration & Enhancement

## ðŸ“‹ Current Status

âœ… **Core Issues Resolved:**

- Touch target accessibility issue fixed (WCAG compliance)
- Visual regression tests stabilized and baseline images updated
- All accessibility tests passing (35/35)
- Navigation component improved with proper touch target sizing
- Development-only elements excluded from accessibility testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Phase Objectives

### 1. ðŸ”§ Performance Budget Integration

#### Implementation Steps

- [x] Create `performance-budget.json` with core metrics
- [x] Add performance monitoring utility
- [x] Add npm scripts for performance analysis
- [ ] **Integrate with CI/CD pipeline**
- [ ] Set up automated performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure performance alerts and reporting

#### Performance Metrics to Monitor

- **Bundle Size**: Main bundle < 250KB, vendor < 500KB
- **Load Times**: FCP < 1.5s, LCP < 2.0s, TTI < 3.0s
- **Core Web Vitals**: CLS < 0.1, FID < 100ms
- **Lighthouse Scores**: Performance > 90, Accessibility > 95

### 2. ðŸ§ª CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement

#### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
# Proposed workflow enhancements
name: Advanced Quality Assurance
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  performance-budget:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Performance Budget Check
        run: npm run perf:budget

  visual-regression:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Visual Regression Tests
        run: npm run test:visual

  accessibility-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
